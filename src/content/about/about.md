Hi, I’m **Om Thakur**, a Computer Engineering graduate student at **New York University** with a strong foundation in full-stack development and a growing passion for AI-driven research and systems.

Currently, I’m a **Research Intern** at **NYU Langone Health**, working on cutting-edge healthcare solutions under the guidance of leading researchers. Prior to this, I led and contributed to high-impact engineering projects at 4iBiz, building production-grade software used by thousands of users.

My journey bridges engineering and research, from deploying scalable Angular/React platforms to building LLM-based systems for **mental health support, AI-powered recommendation engines**, and **end-to-end MLOps pipelines** using AWS and Docker. My work has also been published in international journals, including research on **thermal image-based solar panel damage detection**.

Outside of coding, I’m always up for meeting new people, exploring hidden corners of **New York City**, capturing moments through **photography**, or hitting the field for a game of cricket. I’m also a huge fan of How I Met Your Mother, and someone who always shows up for his friends, both in life and in code.
